# weather-app

An MCP server built with [Smithery CLI](https://smithery.ai/docs/getting_started/quickstart_build_python)


# Functions of the tools that are being connected
This weather app has two functions: get alert and get forecast. Get alert gets any weather alert within the U.S. state, and get forecast gets the weather forecast for that location.

To make things more interesting, if you ask the it to speak in a pirate like tone, it can answer your requests with such a tone.
